conexp-clj TODOs

* For 1.0.0
** TODO Implement Christians Force Layout with derivations
** TODO Implement Christians Initial Position Layout
** TODO Rule Exploration with Impex
** TODO GUI context editor
   It's slow, make it faster. If no second operand is given, calling
   the corresponding menu entry produces an unintuitive error.
** TODO GUI lattice editor
** TODO GUI code editor
** TODO GUI plugin browser
** TODO Fix stupid labeling
** TODO Fix Neverending Rotation when switching tabs
   This is a GUI problem.
** TODO Undo for GUI
* For 0.1.0-beta
** TODO Adjusting nodes in lattice diagram with parallelogram rule
* For 0.0.7-alpha
** TODO Rewrite to-inf-additive-layout                               :Daniel:
   As projection into the subspace of all infimum-additive layouts.
** TODO Improve test coverage of conexp contrib                      :Daniel:
** DONE Make Sage interface faster                                   :Daniel:
   CLOSED: [2011-01-22 Sa 20:47]
** TODO Lattice IO for csv and dot                                   :Daniel:
   That should be simple for output, but non-trivial for input.
** TODO More IO formats for contexts                                 :Daniel:
   See the example files from Uta. Also include «anonymous-burmeister».
** TODO Add more layout output                                       :Daniel:
   svg and povray
** INPROGRESS draw-lattice-to-file                                   :Daniel:
   We need some function (i.e. draw-lattice-to-file) which produces a
   file of the picture of a lattice layout, when given the same
   arguments as draw-lattice.

   For this we need some abstrace picture-drawing facility, which can
   produce pictures without showing them. For that we could use svg
   (also as output format for layouts) and simply write it to a file.
** TODO Add support for multiple contexts/... in IO                  :Daniel:
   I.e. a call like

     (write-context :conexp "/tmp/file" ctx-1 ctx-2 ctx-3)

   should be possible. read-context then should also take an index of
   which context to read in.
** TODO Write short documentation                                    :Daniel:
** TODO Change attribute names for mv-context scales                 :Daniel:
   They are somewhat arbitrary and may also be misleading. Don't
   forget to adjust the tests for them after finishing.
** TODO Allow nominals in DL extension                               :Daniel:
** TODO Make output of TBoxes readable                               :Daniel:
** TODO Automatically convert DL expressions to LaTeX                :Daniel:
** TODO Remove reflection warnings from GUI                          :Daniel:
* For 0.0.6-alpha
** DONE Check function names for DL contrib                          :Daniel:
   They mix «interpretation» and «model» in arbitrary ways.
** DONE Restructure layout code                                      :Daniel:
   Some functions (grid adjustment) may just go to util, and the
   freese layout should be in conexp.layout.freese and should provide
   two functions (freese-layout and freese-interactive-layout).
** DONE Write transitive-reduction                                   :Daniel:
   and use it for «luxenburger-basis» and for «edges»
** DONE Improve test coverage of conexp core [5/5]                   :Daniel:
