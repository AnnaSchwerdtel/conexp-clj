* Todo
** GUI
*** TODO Allow resizing of cells in GUI
    For this a special mouse handler has to be implemented that changes the cursor when
    resizing is possible.  Resizing itself must be done via setRowHeight() or one of
    TableColumns methods for setting the width of a column.
*** TODO Use breakable tool bar for context editor
*** TODO GUI context editor
*** TODO GUI lattice editor
*** TODO GUI code editor
*** TODO GUI plugin browser
*** TODO Undo for GUI
** Lattice Drawing
*** TODO Adjusting nodes in lattice diagram with parallelogram rule
*** INPROGRESS draw-lattice-to-file
    We need some function (i.e. draw-lattice-to-file) which produces a
    file of the picture of a lattice layout, when given the same
    arguments as draw-lattice.

    For this we need some abstrace picture-drawing facility, which can
    produce pictures without showing them. For that we could use svg
    (also as output format for layouts) and simply write it to a file.
** IO
*** TODO Add tests for explicit IO formats
    given as keywords or strings.
*** INPROGRESS Allow additional arguments to write-context
    depending on the current layout.
*** INPROGRESS More IO formats for contexts [2/5]
    - [X] anonymous burmeister (without names for objects and
      attributes)
    - [ ] csc
    - [ ] slf
    - [ ] csx
    - [X] binary csv
*** TODO Lattice IO for csv and dot
    That should be simple for output, but non-trivial for input.
*** TODO Add support for multiple contexts/... in IO
    I.e. a call like

      (write-context :conexp "/tmp/file" ctx-1 ctx-2 ctx-3)

    should be possible. read-context then should also take an index of
    which context to read in.
** Tests
*** INPROGRESS Improve test coverage of conexp contrib [0/12]             :7:
    - [ ] algorithms
    - [ ] concept approximation
    - [ ] DL
    - [ ] draw (?)
    - [ ] exec
    - [ ] experimental
    - [ ] factor analysis
    - [ ] fuzzy [0/3]
      - [ ] logics
      - [ ] sets
      - [ ] fca
    - [ ] GUI (?)
    - [ ] Java
    - [ ] retracts
    - [ ] util [0/1]
      - [ ] general sorted sets
*** INPROGRESS Add tests for new Association Rule functions               :7:
** Layout
*** INPROGRESS Add more layout output [0/2]
    - [ ] svg
    - [ ] povray
*** TODO Rewrite to-inf-additive-layout                                   :7:
    As projection into the subspace of all infimum-additive layouts.
*** TODO Implement Christians Force Layout with derivations
*** UNCERTAIN Implement Christians Initial Position Layout
** Documentation
*** INPROGRESS Write short documentation                                  :7:
** Core
*** TODO Change attribute names for mv-context scales                     :7:
    They are somewhat arbitrary and may also be misleading. Don't
    forget to adjust the tests for them after finishing.
*** TODO Make luxenburger-base parallel                                   :7:
*** TODO Rule Exploration with Impex
* Bugs
** DONE 001 Contexts in ConExp format are not read in properly.
   The testing context nn_5.half.cex has problems when read in, the names of the objects and
   attributes are wrong.

   This can be fixed by taking all the content (not only the first element) of the appropiate
   element of the xml file.
** TODO 002 Fix stupid labeling of concept lattices
** TODO 003 Fix Neverending Rotation when switching tabs
   When rotating the lattice and switching panels, rotation does not stop and overrides the current
   panel.

** TODO 004 Unintuive Error when no second operand given
   In the GUI, if no second operand is given but needed, the resulting error is very uninformative.
** TODO 005 GUI icons don't show up under windows
   probably a path problem
