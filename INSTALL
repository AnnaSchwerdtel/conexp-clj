Installation Instructions for conexp-clj
---------------------------------------

To compile conexp-clj from source you need leiningen (at least version 1.2.0),
a build tool for clojure. To get it just issue

  $ wget http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/raw/stable/bin/lein

put the file lein in your path, make it executable and run

  $ lein self-install

That's it. Note that this works for Linux and Unix systems. For
Windows there is some experimental version of leiningen, please see
the corresponding website for this.

Now switch in the source directory of conexp-clj and run

  $ lein deps

This will download any missing jar files needed for conexp-clj to run. With
this you can now run conexp-clj directly from source and hack in its internals!
For a fast repl run

  $ lein repl

If you want a swank server, run

  $ lein swank

and connnect your Emacs (or whatever) to Port 4005 at 127.0.0.1. See the
documentation of swank-clojure for more details on this.

To create a standalone zip just call bundle.sh in the top source
directory. This will do everything to create a zip archive containing
a compiled version of conexp-clj. You can also run this compiled version
directly by invoking ./conexp-clj/bin/conexp-clj.sh.

Happy Hacking!
