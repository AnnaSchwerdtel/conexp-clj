Installation Instructions for conexp-clj
---------------------------------------

To compile conexp-clj from source you need leiningen, a build tool for
clojure. To get it just issue

  $ wget http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/raw/stable/bin/lein

put the file lein in your path, make it executable and run

  $ lein self-install

That's it. Note that this works for Linux and Unix systems. For
Windows there is some experimental version of leiningen, please see
the corresponding website for this.

Now switch in the source directory of conexp-clj and run

  $ lein deps

This will download any missing jar files needed for conexp-clj to run,
except for one (G.jar), which you have to copy manually

  $ cp src/lib/*.jar lib

With this you can now run conexp-clj directly from source and hack in
its internals!

To create a standalone zip just call bundle.sh in the top source
directory. This will do everything to create a zip archive containing
a compiled version of conexp-clj.

Happy Hacking!
