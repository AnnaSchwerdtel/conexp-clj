Hacking conexp-clj
==================

Programming for conexp-clj follows some simple rules which could be
described best as some kind of "Conceptual Programming":

- Functions implement concepts (of the human mind), variables denote
  concepts.

- Functions and variables use other functions and variables if and
  only if the concept implemented by the former is a superconcept of
  the concept implemented by the latter.

- Function and variable names denote the concept they implement.

- A docstring of a function describes the concept it implements, not
  the function itself.

Furthermore common sense applies, e.g.

- Comments are used for structring code (headlines) or describing
  technical difficult situations, not for stating obvious things.

- Rules are for guiding you through difficult situations, not for
  driving you crazy.

Last, but not least:

- Files end with nil
