* Script
** DONE Add readline support
   using jline
* Lattice Drawing
** TODO Adjusting nodes in lattice diagram with parallelogram rule
** NEXT draw-lattice-to-file
   We need some function (i.e. draw-lattice-to-file) which produces a
   file of the picture of a lattice layout, when given the same
   arguments as draw-lattice.

   For this we need some abstrace picture-drawing facility, which can
   produce pictures without showing them. For that we could use svg
   (also as output format for layouts) and simply write it to a file.
* IO
** TODO Add tests for explicit IO formats
   given as keywords or strings.
** NEXT Allow additional arguments to write-context
   depending on the current layout.
** NEXT More IO formats for contexts [2/5]
   - [X] anonymous burmeister (without names for objects and
     attributes)
   - [ ] csc
   - [ ] slf
   - [ ] csx
   - [X] binary csv
** TODO Lattice IO for csv and dot
   That should be simple for output, but non-trivial for input.
** TODO Add support for multiple contexts/... in IO
   I.e. a call like

     (write-context :conexp "/tmp/file" ctx-1 ctx-2 ctx-3)

   should be possible. read-context then should also take an index of
   which context to read in.

   They are somewhat arbitrary and may also be misleading. Don't

* GUI
** TODO Allow resizing of cells in GUI
   For this a special mouse handler has to be implemented that changes the cursor when
   resizing is possible.  Resizing itself must be done via setRowHeight() or one of
   TableColumns methods for setting the width of a column.
