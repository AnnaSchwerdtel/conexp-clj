conexp-clj
==========

How to run
----------

If you just downloaded the .zip file you can run conexp-clj by running
./bin/conexp-clj.sh (or .bat when you have Windows) and you will get
a prompt for conexp-clj.

If you prefer a gui version (which is not finished yet), you may pass
--gui.

When you want to run conexp-clj from source directly (i.e. not via
conexp-clj.sh) then make sure you have set up the classpath correctly
and simply (use 'conexp.main).

Have Fun!
